# 🧩 n8n Workflows Repository

Welcome to the **n8n Workflows** repository! This repo contains a collection of reusable, modular, and production-ready **n8n workflows**, each organized in its own dedicated folder. These workflows are built for different automation use cases — ranging from data sync, APIs, lead management, and AI integrations to notifications and internal tool automation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone n8n workflow or project. 


Each folder typically contains:

- `workflow.json` — the actual n8n exported workflow
- `README.md` — description and usage of that specific workflow
- `env.example` (optional) — example of required environment variables
